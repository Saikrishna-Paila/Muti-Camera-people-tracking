# Multi Camera People Tracking

![results](./results/results.gif "results")

## Description

Surveillance camera is basically like a normal camera but with high resistance for any condition and placed on the ceiling of the room. Because of that, the basic skill of a surveillance camera like a normal camera is just recording anything inside them, without knowing who they are and what they are doing. The purpose of this project is to give the sequence video, after that detecting people and making it different from each other or labeling each other with some number and connecting each other cameras. Created with YOLOv4-tiny for object detection models and Omni-Scale for person re-identification models.

## Installation

```bash
# Python version 3.7.9 or newer
$ git clone https://github.com/hafidh561/multi-camera-people-tracking.git
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
$ python3 download_model.py
```

## Usage

```bash
$ python3 main.py -h
usage: main.py [-h] [-s SOURCE_CONFIG_FILE]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -s SOURCE_CONFIG_FILE, --source-config-file SOURCE_CONFIG_FILE
                        Input your config.yaml file
```
